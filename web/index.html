				<h1>Vircadia Community Applications Repository</h1>
				<p>This repository stores optional <b>tablet applications</b> and <b>functionalities</b> provided by the contributions of the community members. 
				If you have created an Application or functionality script and want to offer it to the community, this is where you can do it.</p>

				<h2>Before going further:</h2><ol>
					<li>If your application/functionality is a <b>core feature</b> that you think should be <b>delivered out-of-the-box with Vircadia</b>, you must instead consider making your contribution directly in the <b>Vircadia</b> code repository. See instead the <b><a href = 'https://github.com/kasenvr/project-athena'>Vircadia</a></b> repository and contact the core team.</li><br>
					<li>If your application/functionality has a <b>dependency with on an external server or services</b> (if it has to deal in any ways with other servers than a Vircadia Domain or Metaverse API), then this repository is not where you should publish your application. It will have to be published to a different source like the <b>Marketplace</b> (when it is created) or another web site.</li>
				</ol>
				<br>
				<h2>Conditions for acceptance:</h2><ol>
				<li>You must include a <b>license</b> reference in your files to make your script fully open source:<br>
				<font class = 'greencommented' >//  Distributed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.<br>
				//  See the accompanying file LICENSE or http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html</font><br>
				</li><br>
				<li>Avoid <b>spaces</b> and <b>special characters</b> in your <b>folders</b> and <b>file names</b>.<br><font class = 'greencommented' >(Stay with: "<b>a-z</b>", "<b>A-Z</b>", "<b>0-9</b>", "<b>-</b>", "<b>_</b>", "<b>.</b>")</font></li><br>

				<li>Add your application/functionality in a <b>folder</b> under the "<b><a href = 'https://github.com/kasenvr/community-apps/tree/master/applications'>applications</a></b>" directory.<br>
				<font class = 'greencommented' >(Your main js file and your icon must be directly in that folder)</font></li><br>

				<li>You must add your application/functionality to the "<b>metadata.js</b>" file (in the "<b><a href = 'https://github.com/kasenvr/community-apps/tree/master/applications'>applications</a></b>" directory) by generating a new one using this tool: <b><a href='metadata_js_generator.html'>Metadata Generator</a></b></li>
				</ol>

				<p><b>Submit a "<u>Pull Request</u>" to add your "<u>application folder</u>" and the new "<u>metadata.js</u>" file.</b><br>
				<font class = 'greencommented' >(If you are not comfortable with these procedures, contact <b>Keb Helion</b> on Vircadia Discord.)</font></p>


				<br>
				<h2>Guidelines for the code reviewer:</h2><ol>
				<li>Test the applications in <b>Vircadia</b>.</li><br>
				<li>Make sure that the <b>JSON</b> and <b>Javascript</b> contained in "<b>metadata.js</b>" are <u>valid</u> before accepting the pull request!<b> This will affect the production "More" application immediately for all users.</b></li><br>

				<h1>Overte Community Applications Repository</h1>
				<p>This repository stores optional <b>tablet applications</b> provided by the contributions of community members. 
				If you have created an application for Overte and want to offer it to the community, this is where you can do it.</p>

				<h2>Before going further:</h2><ol>
					<li>If your application is a <b>core feature</b> that you think should be <b>installed by default for all Overte users</b>, you should instead consider making your contribution directly in the <b>Overte code repository</b>. See the <b><a href = 'https://github.com/overte-org/overte'>Overte</a></b> repository and contact the core team.</li><br>
					<li>If your application is <b>dependent on an external server or service</b> (if it has to deal in any way with servers other than a Overte Domain or Metaverse API), then this repository is not where you should publish your application. It will have to be published to a different source, like the <b>Marketplace</b> (when it is created) or another web site.</li>
				</ol>
				<br>
				<h2>Conditions for acceptance:</h2><ol>
				<li>You must include a <b>license</b> reference in your files to make your script fully open source:<br>
				<font class = 'greencommented' >//  Distributed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.<br>
				//  See the accompanying file LICENSE or http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html</font><br>
				</li><br>
				<li>Avoid <b>spaces</b> and <b>special characters</b> in your <b>folders</b> and <b>file names</b>.<br><font class = 'greencommented' >(Stay with: "<b>a-z</b>", "<b>A-Z</b>", "<b>0-9</b>", "<b>-</b>", "<b>_</b>", "<b>.</b>")</font></li><br>

				<li>Add your application in a <b>folder</b> under the "<b><a href = 'https://github.com/overte-org/community-apps/tree/master/applications'>applications</a></b>" directory.<br>
				<font class = 'greencommented' >(Your main js file and your icon must be directly in that folder)</font></li><br>

				<li>You must add your application to the "<b>metadata.js</b>" file (in the "<b><a href = 'https://github.com/overte-org/community-apps/tree/master/applications'>applications</a></b>" directory) by generating a new one using this tool: <b><a href='metadata_js_generator.html'>Metadata Generator</a></b></li>
				</ol>

				<p><b>Submit a "<u>Pull Request</u>" to add your "<u>application folder</u>" and the new "<u>metadata.js</u>" file.</b><br>
				<font class = 'greencommented' >(If you are not comfortable with these procedures, contact <b>the core members</b> on Overte Discord.)</font></p>


				<br>
				<h2>Guidelines for the code reviewer:</h2><ol>
				<li>Test the applications in <b>Overte</b>.</li><br>
				<li>Make sure that the <b>JSON</b> and <b>Javascript</b> contained in "<b>metadata.js</b>" are <u>valid</u> before accepting the pull request!<b> This will affect the production "More" application immediately for all users.</b></li><br>
				<li>Test the "<b>More...</b>" application in <b>Overte</b>.</li>
